ðŸŽ–Additional Reading Material of Week1:
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/?trk=fecf68c9-3874-4ae2-a7ed-72b6d19c8034&sc_channel=ps&sc_campaign=acquisition&sc_medium=ACQ-P|PS-GO|Brand|Desktop|SU|Storage|S3|US|EN|Text&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!488982706722!e!!g!!amazon%20s3&ef_id=CjwKCAjw6MKXBhA5EiwANWLODMRb8uj_YtDqcbwkSuf10xHCyAP3Hx-iZm0gZZyIK2dSSkVy-M7BCBoCyTwQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!488982706722!e!!g!!amazon%20s3): Store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, cloud-native applications, backups, archive, machine learning, and analytics.

- [AWS Data Wrangler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler): Pandas on AWS

- [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc): AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It move data from one location to another, acting as an Extract, Transform, Load(ETL) service. 

- [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc): Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. (It takes a bunch of CSV or JSON files in a S3 Bucket and load them into temporary SQL tables, so that you can run SQL squeries.)

- Amazon SageMaker: service to build, train, and deloy machine learning models at scale
1) Apache MXNet on AWS: open-source deep learning framework
2) Tensorflow on AWS: open-source machine intelligence library
3) PyTorch on AWS: open-source machine learning framework
